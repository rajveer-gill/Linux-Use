# Linux Directories

## Description
I built this project to show my skills when it comes to linex and file management. The script helps creates directories and branchs within a system.
This project taught me more about the accessibility of files and how programmers can interact with this.

## Features
This script utilizes the linux system to create parent and child directories that branch off to their own sub catagories.
These side branches have files implemented into them and have their permisions changed to affect who can access them.
